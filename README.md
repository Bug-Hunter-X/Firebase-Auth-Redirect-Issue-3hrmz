This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication where the redirect after successful login fails to function as expected. The `authBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `authSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.  The issue arises from improper handling of the authentication state change listener and the redirection process. The solution ensures that the redirect occurs only after successful authentication and uses appropriate error handling.
